# tte
### (Tiny) Tree Editor

This is a small program written in Lua for the Love2d platform.
It is used to create, edit and save tree structures. It can be 
used to explore language constructs directly in a tree structure.
It can also be used to generate outline based documentation. See
the file USAGE.md for more information on using tte.

Along with the tree editor it contains an interface to the alsa 
midi sequencer. This can be used to explore a musical language
that has been developed with tte. See the file MUSIC.md.
