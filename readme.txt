README for (Tiny) Tree Editor

This application runs on the LOVE2d game engine. See http://love2d.org homepage for more
information and to download the engine for various platforms. It is tested on Love 0.10.2.

You can run the editor application by starting the love engine while pointing it to the 
application tte.love. How this is done does depends on your platform, generally you can 
drop the application icon onto the love engine application to start. It can also be started
from the command line by supplying swte.love as the first argument.

Alternately, you can place all the project files in a directory, then point the love engine
to that directory. These files can be taken from the repository, or from the tte.love file
itself. To to that rename tte.love to tte.zip and unzip it.
